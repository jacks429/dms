Offering a high-performance solution for identifying entities across data sources like search engines. This setup dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload demands, ensuring efficient processing and scalability. With real-time entity recognition, organizations can extract valuable insights and make informed decisions, driving innovation in data-driven environments. Furthermore, the deployment of NER models is facilitated by the availability of free open-source models, such as those provided by Hugging Face, streamlining implementation and reducing development time.\r\nWe can tune the model to also be able to recognize entities in slovikan as this model is already fine-tuned for multi-language support already currently working with en, es, fr, it, nl, pl, pt, ru and zh. With an overall precision rate of 93.39. Supporting Label sets such as PER(people), ORG(organization), LOC (location), ANIM (animal), CEL (celestial) ,DIS (disease), EVE (event), etc.</p>\n<p>The application will utilize an algorithm to compare entities in the database with those identified through Named Entity Recognition (NER). This assessment will determine the percentage of entities found by NER, guiding improvements in data coverage and NER accuracy for the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic.</p>\n<p>Prior Training of this model is well documented making re-creation of experiments in another language or for additional Labels a very easy simple process.\r\nAstros Island Architecture\r\nAstro’s Island Architecture offers robust and modular design, allowing each application component to operate independently within its own island. This enables seamless integration of various node frameworks without conflicts. Islands represent distinct parts of the application, facilitating microservices-driven development where different services communicate via APIs. Despite diverse node frameworks used in each island, efficient data exchange ensures smooth operation of the overall application, optimizing scalability and performance. With Astro, developers leverage this flexibility to tap into a vast ecosystem of node frameworks and libraries, crafting tailored solutions for complex software challenges.</p>\n<p>Security\r\nIntegrating Astro-Auth with Lucia’s OAuth implementation further strengthens the security and access control mechanisms of the application, ensuring secure authentication and authorization for accessing register data and versions.
